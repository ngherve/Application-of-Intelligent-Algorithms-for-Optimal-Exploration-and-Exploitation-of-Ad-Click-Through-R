# Application-of-Intelligent-Algorithms-for-Optimal-Exploration-and-Exploitation-of-Ad-Click-Through-R
Recently, the field of reinforcement learning is used to address prob-lems in a wide variety of domains, including clinical trials, recommender sys-tems, telecommunications, computer games, and economics. The exploration and exploitation dilemma are fundamental aspects of classical reinforcement learning applications, and the multi-armed bandit problem is one of the simplest instances of its study and application. This research aims to explore multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance the exploration and exploitation tradeoff, thereby providing a novel framework solution for optimizing click-through rate in recommender systems. To that end, algorithms were designed for an advertising platform with variable parameters, through which dynamic evaluation was conducted to achieve high performance. Our results show that UCB1 performs best with an increase in the number of iterations (user records). Experiments conducted over various values of ùúñ and ùúè for the respective greedy and SoftMax algorithms show that an increase in these values lowers the expected cumulative reward over the iterations. UCB1 achieves the highest overall average reward for selecting the best arm over the iterations.
